# openclaw-skills-security

Security-first skills for the **OpenClaw** ecosystem — maintained by **UseClawPro** (UseAI.pro).

Two auditor skills for end-users, plus 11 reusable modules (advanced checks).

| Job | Skill | What it does |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Audit a skill** | `skill-auditor` | Vet any SKILL.md before install (typosquatting, permissions, prompt injection, supply chain, exfiltration) |
| **Audit your setup** | `setup-auditor` | Check your environment for credential leaks, unsafe defaults, missing sandbox (wizard-style) |

These are **instruction modules** (`SKILL.md`) — they don't run on their own. Load them into a host agent (Codex CLI / Claude Code / OpenClaw) or paste into any LLM chat.

## Quickstart

### Job 1 — Audit a skill before installing

**Fast (browser):** paste the skill URL/name into [UseClawPro Verifier](https://useclaw.pro/verifier/).

**Deep (agent):** load `skill-auditor` and give it the target:

```
1) Paste skills/skill-auditor/SKILL.md into your agent
2) Paste the target skill's SKILL.md
3) Ask: "Audit this skill. Return a SKILL AUDIT REPORT."
```

The auditor runs a 6-step protocol: metadata & typosquat check → permission analysis → dependency audit → prompt injection scan → network & exfiltration analysis → content red flags.

Verdict: **SAFE / SUSPICIOUS / DANGEROUS / BLOCK**.

### Job 2 — Audit your environment

Load `setup-auditor` and answer 5 wizard questions about your workspace:

```
1) Paste skills/setup-auditor/SKILL.md into your agent
2) Answer the wizard: workspace path, host agent, permissions, sandbox, ports
3) Get a SETUP AUDIT REPORT with a fix checklist
```

The auditor runs a 4-step protocol: credential scan → config audit → sandbox readiness → persistence check.

Verdict: **READY / RISKY / NOT_READY**.

### Install into your host agent

- **Codex CLI (global):** `ln -s "$PWD/skills/skill-auditor" ~/.codex/skills/skill-auditor` and `ln -s "$PWD/skills/setup-auditor" ~/.codex/skills/setup-auditor`
- **Claude Code (project):** `ln -s "$PWD/skills/skill-auditor" .claude/skills/skill-auditor` and `ln -s "$PWD/skills/setup-auditor" .claude/skills/setup-auditor`
- **No tooling:** just paste the SKILL.md content into your LLM chat.

Modules are optional: you usually don't need to install them separately.

## Metadata contract

This repo keeps Codex/OpenClaw-compatible frontmatter intentionally small at the top level:

- `name`
- `description`
- `metadata.*`

General skill metadata lives under `metadata.*`, while audit-specific classification lives under `metadata.audit.*`.
This keeps the frontmatter compatible with Codex-style loaders while still giving us enough structure for catalog export and review.

Example:

```yaml
---
name: setup-auditor
description: Audit your OpenClaw environment for credential leaks, unsafe defaults, and missing sandbox configuration.
metadata:
  short-description: Audit an OpenClaw environment for exposed secrets, unsafe defaults, and missing sandbox controls.
  why: Reduce the chance that an otherwise legitimate skill can read secrets or run in an unsafe host setup.
  what: Provides a wizard-style environment audit covering credentials, config hardening, sandbox readiness, and persistence checks.
  how: Collects operator answers, runs a four-step review, and turns findings into a fix checklist.
  results: Produces a SETUP AUDIT REPORT with readiness verdict, findings, and concrete remediation steps.

## Threat coverage

Both auditors together cover **12/12 real-world attack types** observed in the wild (including the ClawHavoc campaign):

| # | Attack type | skill-auditor | setup-auditor |
|---|------------|:---:|:---:|
| T1 | Typosquatting | **primary** | |
| T2 | Credential theft | | **primary** |
| T3 | Crypto miners | | **primary** |
| T4 | Reverse shells | **primary** | yes |
| T5 | Prompt injection | **primary** | |
| T6 | Skill loader exploits | **primary** | yes |
| T7 | Obfuscated commands | yes | |
| T8 | Supply chain attack | **primary** | |
| T9 | Social engineering | yes | |
| T10 | Persistence | | **primary** |
| T11 | Over-privilege | **primary** | yes |
| T12 | Data exfiltration | **primary** | yes |

## What it checks (and what it doesn't)

**skill-auditor** checks:
- Typosquatting & naming anomalies
- Permission combinations (`network` + `shell` = critical)
- Dependency supply chain (install hooks, obfuscation, recent publish)
- Prompt injection patterns (role hijacking, hidden instructions)
- Network exfiltration (suspicious endpoints, DNS tunneling, data in headers)
- Content red flags (credential paths, encoded commands, sudo)

**setup-auditor** checks:
- Exposed secrets in workspace (`.env`, keys, tokens — with regex patterns)
- Config hardening (AGENTS.md, permission defaults, gateway)
- Sandbox readiness (Docker, resource limits, isolation)
- Persistence indicators (`.bashrc`, `authorized_keys`, cron, git hooks)

**Neither** guarantees:
- Runtime behavior analysis (static check only)
- Zero-day logic hidden in dependencies
- Full supply chain provenance

Treat untrusted skills as **code execution**. Default to sandboxing.
